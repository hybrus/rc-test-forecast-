### Design
The "RC Test Forecast" application is a React application that displays the current weather conditions and forecast for a specific location. The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap components. The weather data is obtained from the AccuWeather API, and the auto-detect feature for the user's location is implemented using the geolocation-db API.

The main components of the user interface include:

* A search bar that allows the user to enter a location to display the weather information.
* A weather card that displays the current weather conditions and forecast for the selected location.
* A feature that allows the application to detect the user's location automatically using the geolocation-db API.

### Functionality
The "RC Test Forecast" application allows the user to perform the following tasks:

* Search for weather information: The user can search for the weather information of a specific location by entering the location name in the search bar. When the user submits the search query, the application retrieves the weather data from the AccuWeather API and displays it on the weather card.
* Display current weather conditions: The weather card displays the current weather conditions of the selected location, including the temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather condition.
* Display weather forecast: The weather card also displays the weather forecast for the selected location, including the high and low temperatures, and the weather description for each day.
* Auto-detect user's location: The application has a feature that allows it to detect the user's location automatically using the geolocation-db API. When the user allows the application to access their location, the application retrieves the location information and displays the weather information for that location on the weather card.

### Usage
To use the "RC Test Forecast" application, the user must have a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can then run the application by downloading the repository. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace `REACT_APP_ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY`  and running the `npm install` command to install the required dependencies. Once the dependencies have been installed, the user can run the application using the `npm start` command.

Once the application is running, the user can search for the weather information of a specific location by entering the location name in the search bar. If the user allows the application to access their location, the application will display the weather information for that location on the weather card. The user can also view the weather forecast by clicking on the arrow on the weather card.

### Limitations
The "RC Test Forecast" application is a simple demo that is designed to display the weather information and forecast for a specific location. As such, it has several limitations, including:

* Limited functionality: The application only displays the weather information and forecast for a specific location. It does not provide more advanced features, such as weather alerts or historical weather data.
* Data source: The weather data is obtained from the AccuWeather API, which may not be accurate or up-to-date in all cases. The application may not display the correct weather information for certain locations or weather conditions.
* Compatibility: The application may not work on all web browsers or on mobile devices. It is designed to work on modern web browsers that support HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but may not work on older browsers or devices with limited processing power.
